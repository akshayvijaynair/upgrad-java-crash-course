/**
 * omprehension: Day of the week
 *
 * Letâ€™s say that the 1st of January of a given non-leap year is a Monday.
 *Write a program that takes the day number and returns what day it is.
 *
 * Hint: The first day is a Monday, the second is a Tuesday, the third is a Wednesday, and so on.
 * Then, the eighth day will be a Monday again, the ninth will be a Tuesday, and the tenth will be a Wednesday.
 * So day number %7 could help you frame the logic here.
